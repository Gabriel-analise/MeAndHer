# Couple Info System

This project is a simple system created with the sole purpose of improving my programming skills and revisiting concepts I already know. It is not intended for any production use or deployment, but rather as a personal exercise to enhance my understanding of development.

The system focuses on displaying information about a couple (in this case, me and my girlfriend). It is designed to be straightforward, showcasing basic features while allowing me to explore and refine my coding practices.

## Features

- Display personal information about each individual in the couple.
- Simple and clean interface to present the data.
- Opportunity to practice structuring a basic system.

## Goals

1. Practice and review fundamental programming concepts.
2. Experiment with creating a small yet functional system.
3. Gain confidence in structuring a project from scratch.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gabriel-analise/MeAndHer
